## Problem Statement

Road accidents often go unnoticed or are reported late, especially on highways and during night hours.  
The delay in informing emergency services results in loss of critical time, increasing the risk of fatalities.

##  Solution

This system automates accident reporting by:
- Capturing live camera input from the frontend
- Allowing snapshot capture during an accident
- Sending the snapshot to the backend
